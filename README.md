# Overview

This project is a modular "Hello World" application written in Python.
It was created to validate my development environment and software
publishing workflow, including version control, documentation, and
code organization.

The software prints a greeting message to the console using a clean,
maintainable structure rather than a single inline statement.

The purpose of creating this software is to practice structuring a
simple application using modules and classes, preparing for more
complex software development tasks later in the course.

Git was used for version control, and GitHub was used to host the public
repository.

The programming language used for this project is Python 3.
